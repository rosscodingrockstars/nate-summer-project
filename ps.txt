First, I have to make it so that the play button actually works when I click the play button the game starts. 
Then, I need to make a random number generator, and also make it appear on the page after the play button is clicked,
and it needs to stay there for the length of the game. I also need to create something that shows the total score, and numbers need to be added onto It after clicking one of the four currencies I'm using.
When you click something that is not on the page, It should not add to the total value.
There also needs to be random number generators for each of the currencies between two numbers such as 3 as the lowest, and 12 as the highest.
If I go over the targeted score, the game should instantly end, and a loss should be added to the losses counter.
If I get the exact targeted score, the game should instantly end, and a win should be added to the wins counter.
All of the previous numbers should be re-rolled again and have a number fill their spot, so that It's different every time even when not resetting the page.
